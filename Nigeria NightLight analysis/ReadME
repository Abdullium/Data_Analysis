The relationship between nighttime lights and wealth is a widely studied phenomenon. This Project uses the Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey as an example to demonstrate this relationship. The data used in the study requires registration to download, but if run locally, it uses synthetic data generated randomly. The study aimed to show that areas with higher levels of nighttime lights are generally associated with higher levels of wealth and assets.
