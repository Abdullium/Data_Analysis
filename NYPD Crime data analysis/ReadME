About This Dataset:-
This Dataset Includes All Valid Felony, Misdemeanour, And Violation Crimes Reported To The New York City Police Department (NYPD) For All Complete Quarters Of The Year (2019)

Background:- In Many Other Cities, Open Data Is A Technical Policy Or An Executive Order. In New York City, It’s The Law. On March 7, 2012, Former Mayor Bloomberg Signed Local Law 11 Of 2012, More Commonly Known As The “Open Data Law,” Which Amended The New York City Administrative Code To Mandate That All Public Data Be Made Available On A Single Web Portal By The End Of 2018. In November 2015, January 2016, And December 2017, Mayor De Blasio Approved Several Amendments To The Open Data Law. These Laws, Which Include Stronger Requirements On Data Dictionaries And Data Retention, Response Timelines For Public Requests, And An Extension Of The Open Data Mandate Into Perpetuity, Help Make It Easier For New Yorkers To Access City Data Online And Anchor The City’s Transparency Initiatives Around Open Data
